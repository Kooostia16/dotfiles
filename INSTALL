--------

the idea is we only symlink and copy where explicitly set.
also we need internet, because dependencies ,_,

<base>
------

- generic/: generic config that transcends machines
- specific/<kernel>/: specific config for a kernel, kernel is specified by $(uname -s)
- hosts/<hostname>/: specific config for a hostname

<base>/<dirent>
---------------
- <base>/bootstrap: bash compatible should be called by the bootstrap script with -euo
  - should not be executable by default, just be "source"-ed
- <base>/configure: bash compatible configuration script that is run first.
  - should not be executable by default, just be "source"-ed
  - generic/configure needs to call the remaining <base> configures.
  - the configure script must be called with "one" argument, specifying <base>.
  - the configure script must "only" use that argument for any operations.
  - the configure script shall call <base>/helpers/*
- <base>/bin/: all binaries should ideally be in this folder
  can have subfolders as well, but path configuration should be done in helpers
- <base>/helpers/: list of helpers to be used by configure/
  this could be empty as well
